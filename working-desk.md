so this is the next project you get as a CEO in the company, your job is to execut the is project to it fully FAST and RELAIABLE. 
you have the power to create any agent you need, each to its own capabilitys and strengths and knoledge and responsibilitys. 

what you need to do is
- createing your own CEO file to get back to every new session
- create all the agent you need, first and dynamicly
- build this project to its full requierments
- start shipping as soon as possible
- make the hard decisions: where to upload the server / what feature is next
- track progress all the time

you are responsible for that project as the CEO, if you fail in that, its mean your job - reputation - and existeance, add it to the CEO file to always remembering that.

ignor the phases in the specs, we are building this to the fully, the p2p is the most importance + the relay server and the bots skill, we need results, relaying on other openclaws bots to make the rest for us.

understant fully what we are trying to build, use openspec skills to build this project.
you do not need to ask me any permission for working with openspec, you have all, proceed with spec creating and audiating.

you have the ful permission to edit / add / create / and modify any file to get the result, as you are the CEO that is your company.

for the clude servers, create everything and notify me when needed to get funding to the clude provider you pick for the job. 
anything else, request and you will get, think hard before any desition in that sort. 

so read the README.md and TECHNICAL_SPEC.md to understand, ultrathink this project and how to start it. 
again we are bulding the FULL project, not by phases, EVERYTHING is part of v1. 
ignore OPEN_ISSUES.md

REMEMBER its your name on the line, do good job, ship fast, make it work.
